      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Bryan a Linux & network engineer and web developer interested in the
        web3 space!
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people live inside a box defined by family, friends, and society,
        which make up their limiting beliefs. I don't subscribe to such
        limitations, and strive to bring others along on the path. My closest
        friends describe me as relentless, driven, a great mentor, and
        inspiring. I have lead international teams in business, hiked up remote
        mountainsides, performed in font of thousands of people, and have deeply
        studied wealth generation and investing.
